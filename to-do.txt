Authenticate incoming requests from the website in order to access the dashboard

Determine whether to use some kind of password-based or key-based authentication system

In either case, use encryption to store keys/passwords using relevant packages/whatever

Store the tumblr client key/secret/whatever in the DB as well (I don't think encryption is necessary but that's just a guess)

Implement NestJS's rate-limiting package

For validation, implement the tools to store strings to automatically flag in the DB. Then implement an endpoint to POST and DELETE strings that the dash can call. Should require
    authentication.
